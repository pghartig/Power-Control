\section{Game and System Setup}

This game considers a wireless communications network which includes a both macro cell and femto cell users.

\subsection{Players}

Individual femto cell base stations (FC-BS) are the players in this game.
\\
Each FC-BS  $f \in \{1 ... F\}$ is considered to have a number of antennas $T_f$ with which to transmit to $K_f$ femto cell users.
\\

In this setting FC-BS are assumed to be spaced far apart in distance permitting the simplification that 
FC-BS $f$ cause no interference to the users of FC-BS $j \in \{1 ... F\}\backslash f$
\\


FC-BSs with multiple antennas can beamform their transmission with transformation $\mathbf{U_f} \in \mathbb{C}_{T_f \times K_f}$.
\\

FC-BS $f$ has power constraint  $\sum^{K_f}_{i=1} p_{f,i} \leq P^{Total}_{f} $. 
\\

FC-BSs are assumed to have a utility function $U_f()$ based upon the quality of service provided to its users.
\\

Macro Cell user $m \in \{1 ... M\}$ experiences receiver interference to due transmission by FC-BSs. These macro cell users have limits to the amount of interference they will tolerate 
$\sum^F_{f=1} \mathbf{p}_f^t \mathbf{\tilde{h_m^T}}  \mathbf{U_f}  \leq I^{Threshold}_{m} $.
\\

FC-BS $f$ is assumed to have full channel information ($\mathbf{H_f}$) for all user  with which it transmits. The received signal for user $j$ of FC-BS $f$ experiences the inner product of $\mathbf{h^H_{fj}u_{fj}}$
\\


Femto cell $f$ is assumed to have full channel information ($\tilde{H_f}$) for all user with which it interferes .
\\


Users of FC-BS $f$ have SINR 


\begin{equation}
\gamma_{f,i} = \frac{p_{f,i}|\mathbf{h^H_{fi}u_{fi}}|^2}
{\sigma^2_{n}  + \sum_{\tilde{f}\neq f} \sum_{u=1}^{K_{\tilde{f}}} + \sum_{\tilde{k}\neq i}} \; i \in \{1 ... K_f\}
\end{equation}
\\
with AWGN $\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_n)$
\\

Assuming sufficient FC-BS spacing this becomes 
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{f,i} = \frac{p_{f,i}|\mathbf{h^H_{fi}u_{fi}}|^2}{\sigma^2_{n}  +  \sum_{\tilde{k}\neq i}} \; i \in \{1 ... K_f\}
\end{equation}
\\

This further simplifies assuming that users use a zero-forcing beam-former

\begin{equation}
\gamma_{f,i} = \frac{p_{f,i}|\mathbf{h^H_{fi}u_{fi}}|^2}{\sigma^2_{n} }
\end{equation}
\\

TODO Decide if there should be minimum rate constraints for users
\\

TODO Try setting the individual user utilities as the capacities then working back to the single covariance matrix from the transmit signal SINR (might be better than optimizing a vector and a matrix)

\subsection{Variations of Game Setup}

\subsubsection{Case: $T_f \geq M + K_f$}
FC-BSs could potentially zero-beam-form towards all macro users. However, as base stations have power constraints, it may be beneficial to cause certain amounts of interference. 

\subsubsection{Case: $K_f \leq T_f < M + K_f$}
FC-BSs can send unique signals to all users but does not have sufficient DOF to zero-beam-form for all macro users.


\subsection{General Optimization Problem}

Each player $f$ attempts to maximize utility function $U_f()$ while playing a strategy that falls in the region constrained by the interference limits imposed by the macro cell users.

The player optimization problem can be written as:
\\

\begin{gather*} 
argmax_{\mathbf{U_f,\mathbf{p}_f}} U_f() 
\\
s.t. \sum^F_{f=1} \mathbf{p}_f^t \mathbf{\tilde{h_m^T}}  \mathbf{U_f}  \leq I^{Threshold}_{m} 
\\
\mathbf{H_f^H}\mathbf{U_f} = \mathbf{I_{K_f}}
\end{gather*}
\\

Alternatively the optimization problem can be written as:
TODO Rewrite zero-forcing constraints
\\
\begin{gather} 
argmax_{\mathbf{U_f}} U_f()\label{utility}
\\
s.t \; \sum^F_{f=1} \mathbf{\tilde{h_m^T}}  \mathbf{U_f}  \leq I^{Threshold}_{m} \label{interference_contstraint}
\\
trace(\mathbf{U_f^H}\mathbf{U_f}) \leq P^{Total}_{f} \label{power_constraint}
\\
\mathbf{H_f^H}\mathbf{U_f} = \mathbf{I_{K_f}}\label{Zero_Forcing}
\end{gather}
\\


\section{Solving the Game}
\subsection{Player Utility Functions}

Say $U_f() $ is the sum of all capacities for femto cell users of FC-BS $f$ 
\begin{displaymath}
U_f(\mathbf{U_f}) = \sum^{K_f}_{i=1} log(1+\gamma_{f,i})
\end{displaymath}

\subsection{Show Convexity of Player Optimization Problem}

Conditions for Convex Problem:
TODO show closed and boundedness of set
\begin{enumerate}
\item Function is convex in argument 
\begin{itemize}
\item\eqref{utility} is concave as there is no interference and log() is concave is the argument, and SINR increases with square of absolute value. (negative second derivative)

\end{itemize}

\item Constraints  form convex, closed and bounded set

\begin{itemize}

\item\eqref{interference_contstraint} contains $M$ affine constraints on $\mathbf{U_f}$

\item\eqref{power_constraint} As Trace is square of Frobenious norm and squaring a convex function (e.g any true Norm) preserves convexity.
Need to work on proof but this should be convex.

\item\eqref{Zero_Forcing} This is a set of linear equations defining $\mathbf{U_f}$ which is an affine set.

\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finding Nash Equilibrium}

Show: Users now have a convex problem to solve individually.

Show: given the above setup, NNE can be found in distributed manner


\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Existence of NE:} Assuming above points on concavity, this is an n-person concave game and therefor a NE exists
\item Diagonally Strict concavity is sufficient condition for uniqueness of NNE in n-person concave game
\begin{itemize}
\item\eqref{utility} has negative second derivative w.r.t the argument and contains no intra-cell interference and therefore is negative definite. 

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
