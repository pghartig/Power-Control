\section{Game and System Setup}

This game considers a wireless communications network which includes a both macro cell and femto cell users.

\subsection{Players}

Individual femto cells are the players in this game.
Here each player  $f \in \{1 ... F\}$ is considered to have a number of antennas $T_f$ with which to transmit to $K_f$ femto cell users.
\\

In this setting femto cells are assumed to be spaced far apart in distance permitting the simplification that 
femto cell $f$ cause no interference to the users of femto cell $j \in \{1 ... F\}\backslash f$
\\


Femto base stations with multiple antennas can beamform their transmission with transformation $\mathbf{U_f} \in \mathbb{C}_{T_f \times L_f}$.
\\

Femto base station $f$ has power constraint  $\sum^{L_f}_{i=1} p_{f,i} \leq P^{Total}_{f} $. 
\\

Femto base stations are assumed to have a utility function $U_f()$ based upon the quality of service provided to its users.
\\

Macro Cell user $m \in \{1 ... M\}$ experiences receiver interference to due transmission by  femto cell base stations. These macro cell users have limits to the amount of interference they will tolerate 
$\sum^F_{f=1} \mathbf{p}_f^t \mathbf{\tilde{h_m^T}}  \mathbf{U_f}  \leq I^{Threshold}_{m} $.
\\

Femto base station $f$ is assumed to have full channel information ($\mathbf{H_f}$) for all user  with which it transmits. The received signal for user $j$ of femto base station $f$ experiences the inner product of $\mathbf{h^H_{fj}u_{fj}}$
\\


Femto cell $f$ is assumed to have full channel information ($\tilde{H_f}$) for all user with which it interferes .
\\


Users of femto cell $f$ have SINR $\gamma_{f,i} = \frac{p_{f,i}|\mathbf{h^H_{fi}u_{fi}}|^2}
{\sigma^2_{n}  + \sum_{\tilde{f}\neq f} \sum_{u=1}^{K_{\tilde{f}}} + \sum_{\tilde{k}\neq i}}+$   $i \in \{1 ... K_f\}$
with AWGN $\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_n)$
\\

Assuming sufficient base station spacing this becomes 
$\gamma_{f,i} = \frac{p_{f,i}|\mathbf{h^H_{fi}u_{fi}}|^2}
{\sigma^2_{n}  +  \sum_{\tilde{k}\neq i}}+$   $i \in \{1 ... K_f\}$
\\

This further simplifies assuming that users use a zero-forcing beam-former
$\gamma_{f,i} = \frac{p_{f,i}|\mathbf{h^H_{fi}u_{fi}}|^2}{\sigma^2_{n} }$
\\

\subsection{Scenarios}

\subsubsection{Case: $T_f \geq M + K_f$}

\subsubsection{Case: $K_f \leq T_f < M + K_f$}

\subsection{Optimization Problem}

Each player $f$ attempts to maximize utility function $U_f()$ while playing a strategy that falls in the region constrained by the interference limits imposed by the macro cell users.

The player optimization problem can be written as:
\\

\begin{gather*} 
U_f() 
\\
s.t. \sum^F_{f=1} \mathbf{p}_f^t \mathbf{\tilde{h_m^T}}  \mathbf{U_f}  \leq I^{Threshold}_{m} 
\end{gather*}
