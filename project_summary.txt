	The objective of this project is to investigate methods for resource allocation in wireless communication systems. In particular,
power allocation to femtocells in heterogeneous networks will be considered. Previous work has shown that in point-to-point
communication systems, distributed update algorithms can be used in order to converge to a unique Nash Equilibrium 
for transmission power under certain condiations of the femtrocell utility function. This work aims to extend these results of
the point-to-point scenario to those  in which femtocell base stations may have multiple antennas with which to transmit to 
multiple end users. The inclusion of multiple transmit antennas at base stations will also allow for investigating beam-forming schemes
that may provide a balance between meeting interference constraints while increasing base station utility.
	This work will incorporate deriving analytical expressions for various results as well as writing simulations for testing these
results.
