This work investigates resource allocation strategies for a communication system with uncoordinated users and MIMO capable base stations. Following a game theoretic solution, it is shown that unlike the SISO case investigated in \cite{ghosh2015normalized}, the general MIMO problem does not admit the N-Concave game framework. Refinements of the general problem are then made to use the N-Concave game framework. These refinements require pre-selection of transmission beamformers prior to the allocation of power and therefore the beamformer design is also considered to increase the achievable player utility. These results are verified and further analyzed in simulations.
