# Resource Allocation using Game Theoretic Strategies
Welcome! The goal of this work is to derive and implement resource allocation stratiegies in a game theoretic manner. In particular, these solutions are aimed at communication networks and therefore, distributed solutions the optimization of the allocation is desired.
