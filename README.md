# Resource Allocation using Game Theoretic Strategies
Welcome! The goal of this work is to derive and implement resource allocation strategies in a game theoretic manner. In particular, these solutions are aimed at communication networks and therefore, distributed solutions for allocation optimization is investigated.
This work can be navigated using the following


1.  [Derivations of allocation strategies](/documentation/readmes/derivations.md)\
This includes a full report of the work with all derivations and an in-depth explanation of the system model.

2.  [Allocation System Model](/documentation/readmes/system_model.md)\
A python module for testing resource allocation in heterogeneous networks. This module can be extended to simulate other types of networks and allocation problems. TODO: describe network interface and how to extend. 

4.  [Simulation Results](/documentation/readmes/results.md)\
A summary of the results for the allocation strategies derived in this work.
